## Summary of Findings

----------
By analyzing this dataset, we were able to find out two very different groups of users, which have distinct ride behaviour and needs. 

- In 2019 we noticed that there were more subscribed riders (members) as compared to casual riders but in 2020, we noticed a reversed trend i.e. casual riders count got increased than subscribed members count. This could be due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, due to which most of the users could have been reluctant to subscribe for Bay Wheels Ride membership.

- In 2019, most rides were taken on weekdays i.e. (M-F) and less on weekends(S,S) while in 2020, we noticed a reverse trend i.e. most of the rides were taken on weekends (S,S) and less on weekdays (M-F).

- We noticed that in 2019, most of the rides are within 1 mile with 0.8 mile being the longest distance and the farthest ride being taken was less than 4.5 mile but in 2020, we noticed that some rides being taken for distance greater than 4.5 mile as well and the maximum bike rides were taken for 0.7 miles.

- We also observed that customers take longer rides than subscribers. This is expected as most of the customers are tourists and will travel longer distances to see the city. In 2020, we noticed an interesting trend where it seemed that customers were more active than subscribers. This is expected as most the people (who are subscribers) were working from home due to COVID-19.

- Overall, we noticed that very less number of bikes were rented in 2020 as compared to 2019. This could be attributed due to covid-19 pandemic situation in 2020 where in people were reluctant to go out. Also in 2020, more bikes were used during 8 am - 5 pm as compared to the rest of the day but we couldn't notice the similar trend where in bikes were mostly rented during peak office hours i.e. 8-9 am in the morning and 3-5 pm in the evening. This could be due to work from home and shelter in place order from April-June 2020
