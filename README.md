# Udacity_Data_Analysis_Nano_Degree
 Below are the projects I did during **Data Analyst Nano Degree**
 
 ## Project 1 - Global Weather Trends 
Below were the tasks performed under this project,   <br>
**->** Extracted the weather data from temperatures MySQL database using SQL and accessed local and global temperature trends.  <br>
**->** Calculated moving averages and compared the temperature trends in my home city (San Jose, CA) to overall global temperature trends.  <br>
**->** Produced a visualization and prepared a report describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends of my home city (San Jose, CA). 
 
 
 ## Project 2 - Investigate TMDB Movies Dataset
Below were the tasks performed under this project,   <br>
**->** Used Python API's to programmatically extract TMDB dataset consisting of 10k+ movies.  <br>
**->** Wrangled & analyzed the data deducing some key insights about user ratings, budget and revenue.  <br>
**->** Generated appropriate visualizations to explain the findings and support the conclusions drawn.  <br>


## Project 3 - Analyze_A_B Test Analysis
Below were the tasks performed under this project,   <br>
**->** Investigated the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to determine if the company should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.  <br>
**->** Analysis was conducted using 3 approaches i.e. probabilistic reasoning, hypothesis testing and logistic regression to cross examine the results produced and draw conclusions.

## Project 4 - Data Wrangling and Analyzing Data
Below were the tasks performed under this project,  <br>
**->** Used Python and its libraries for gathering large data sets from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs in .csv format.  <br>
**->** Assessed them visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues, cleaned each of the issues identified, resulting in a high quality and tidy master dataframes.  <br> 
**->** Performed data analysis on the wrangled data to produce useful insights and visualization to support the analysis.  <br>
**->** Documented all the wrangling efforts and communicated insights in a 250+ words report.

## Project 5 - Bay Wheels Ride Share Dataset Exploration and Visualization
Below were the tasks performed under this project,  <br>
**->** Analyzed BayWheels (Lyft) Bikeshare dataset using python libraries for the year 2019 & 2020 covering SF Bay Area to identify rideshare patterns among users for pre covid and during covid months.  <br>
**->** Gathered, wrangled and cleaned the data from BayWheels data dump to extract subset of relevant observations and features.  <br>
**->** Computed descriptive statistics followed by exploration to discover interesting properties, trends and relationships in the subset.  <br>
**->** Generated a slide deck using nbconvert to convey my findings by transforming the exploratory visualizations into polished, explanatory univariate, bivariate and multivariate visualizations.
